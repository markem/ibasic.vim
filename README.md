# ibasic.vim
A vim repsitory for ibasic

This is the vim resopsitory for the iBasic programming language.  Please create a branch if you decide it needs to be updated and I will merge it into the main trunk if need be.

IBasic is a basic programming language created over ten years ago by pyxia incorporated (www.pyxia.com).  Pyxia became abandonware some time ago and finally the company was sold.  This syntax file is for that language.  There isn't much I can say about now except you might still be able to talk to people who use it at coding monkeys.  I think it is still at www.codingmokeys.com but you probably should Google it since, if I remember correctly, a different website started up a codingmonkeys.com website.  In any case - here is the vim file for ibasic.
